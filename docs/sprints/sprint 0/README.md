Sprint 0 was focused on **framing** the EDU-AGENT pilot, not on implementation.

The main outcomes of Sprint 0 were:

- A clear **problem definition** and vision for EDU-AGENT,
- Challenge briefs for **Team A** and **Team B**,
- An initial **solution architecture** and set of workstreams.

## How to Use This Folder

As a student:

- Read your team’s challenge document (`Challenge 1` or `Challenge 2`) to understand **your problem space**.
- Skim the Solution Workshop Prep and Workshop Notes to understand:
  - Why EDU-AGENT exists,
  - What success looks like for the university,
  - How your work in later sprints fits into the bigger picture.

As a mentor or reviewer:

- Use this folder to check alignment between the original framing and the current sprint work.
- Update the notes if major framing decisions change (e.g., new KPIs, new stakeholders).
