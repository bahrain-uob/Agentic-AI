# Sprint 1 – Overview & Definition of Done

## 1. Sprint Goal

By the end of Sprint 1, we want:

- A clear **PoC charter** and success metrics (KPIs).
- A documented **agent tool list and JSON contracts**.
- An initial **knowledge corpus + RAG design** (sources, metadata, vector store options).
- A first draft of the **student Q&A experience** (journey + low-fi UI).
- A clean **repo structure + basic CI** and **AWS CLI setup** for each team member.

This sprint is about **design + scaffolding**, not full production code.

## 3. Definition of Done (Sprint 1)

A Sprint 1 item is **Done** when:

- [ ] It has a **GitHub issue** with:
  - Clear **title**
  - Short **description** (what/why)
  - **Acceptance criteria** (2–5 bullet points)
  - Relevant **labels** and **assignee**
- [ ] The agreed **document / diagram / code scaffold** exists in the repo
  - In a sensible folder (e.g. `docs/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`)
  - Pushed and visible on GitHub
- [ ] There is at least one **short note** on design decisions
  - Either in the doc itself, or as comments on the issue
- [ ] The GitHub issue is moved to **“Done”** on your team board

## 4. Working Agreements (Sprint 1)

- Communicate blockers early (comment on your issue).
- Small commits, clear messages.
- Ask questions when things are unclear – this is a learning sprint.
