# Student Q&A Experience – Journey & UI Sketch

## 1. Persona

- **Name:** (e.g. "Sara, prospective CS student")
- **Goal:** (e.g. understand options for Cloud track)
- **Context:** (device, language, where they came from)

## 2. Journey Map (Happy Path)

Describe the main path in ~5–10 steps:

1. Student lands on the EDU-AGENT portal.
2. Logs in (or continues as guest).
3. Enters a question in the Q&A box.
4. System shows a loading state.
5. System shows an answer + key bullet points.
6. System shows cited sources / “View the catalogue section”.
7. Student clicks through / asks a follow-up question.

Optionally add a simple table:

| Step | Student Action                   | System Response                           | Notes / Ideas           |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1    |                                  |                                           |                         |
| 2    |                                  |                                           |                         |

## 3. Edge Cases / Error States

- No documents found
- Ambiguous question
- System error / timeout

For each, describe:
- What message the student sees
- What actions they can take

## 4. Low-Fidelity UI Sketch (Text Description)

Describe the key UI elements:

- Layout (where is the question box, where do answers appear?)
- Where citations appear (e.g. right-hand panel for “Sources”)
- Where we might later add filters (programme, year, language)
